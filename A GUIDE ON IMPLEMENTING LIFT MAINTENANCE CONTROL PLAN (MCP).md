<a name="_page2_x69.00_y72.92"></a>INTRODUCTION  

Lifts are an integral part of our daily lives. As the owner of the lift, one has the responsibility to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Besides periodic maintenance, which is crucial in ensuring lifts can operate safely and reliably, the timely replacement of any worn out or broken components before any malfunction or accident occurs is equally important. 

As the lift ages, one would also face issues relating to parts obsolescence, older technology which are of lower safety standards than the latest requirements, as well as general poor condition of aging parts. It is thus important for the lift owner to consider replacing the old lift or modernising it to rejuvenate the equipment.    

This Guide on Implementing the Maintenance Control Plan (MCP) has three key objectives: 

1. Sets out the scope of the MCP for the lift owners, so that they are better aware of the relevant contents to be included, as they develop MCPs for their own lifts with their lift service contractors, in consultation with the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
1. Provides a clearer approach to the lift owners in ensuring safer old lifts (15 years and older) as they face obsolescence of parts for their equipment. 
1. Provides  information  on  modernisation  of  old  lifts  so  that  the  equipment  is rejuvenated. 

Readers are also encouraged to refer to the Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners[^1] on the different approaches in lift maintenance and good practices for lift owners. 

<a name="_page3_x69.00_y72.92"></a>1**  LIFE CYCLE MAINTENANCE OF LIFTS 

1. Regular<a name="_page3_x69.00_y94.92"></a> Maintenance 
1. The  life  cycle  maintenance  of  a  lift  involves  ongoing  care  and  upkeep  from  first installation till its end-of-life as components are subject to wear and tear with continuous usage.  The  Building  Maintenance  and  Strata  Management  (Lift,  Escalator  and  Building Maintenance) Regulations 2016 (henceforth referred to as “LEBM Regulations”) requires lift owner to appoint a lift service contractor to carry out periodic maintenance of the lift. During such maintenance, the lift service contractor is required to ensure that the outcomes as stipulated in Part 1 of the First Schedule of the Regulations are met. The areas of maintenance include the followings:   

   *Table 1: Areas of Maintenance Outcomes for Lifts in Part 1 of the First Schedule of LEBM Regulations.* 



|S/N |Area of maintenance |S/N |Area of maintenance |
| - | - | - | - |
|1 |Door open control |11 |Direct current machine |
|2 |Door protective devices |12 |Overspeed governor |
|3 |Lift car doors and lift landing doors |13 |Main rope and compensation rope |
|4 |Lift car emergency alarm |14 |Compensation rope and compensation rope sheave tie-down and tensioning |
|5 |Lift car intercom |15 |Buffer |
|6 |Emergency power supply for lift car lighting and ventilation |16 |Controller and electrical system |
|7 |Movement of lift car |17 |Guide shoes or rollers of lift car and counterweight |
|8 |Housekeeping |18 |Safety gear |
|9 |Lift machine and drive (including motor, gear box, drive sheave and motor generator set) |19 |General level of corrosion, wear and tear of all lift parts |
|10 |Brakes of lift machine and drive |20 |Stopping or level accuracy |

2. You may also refer to BCA’s Lift Maintenance Outcome Guidebook[^2] for more details on maintenance requirements for lifts. 
2. Parts<a name="_page4_x69.00_y72.92"></a> Replacement 
1. It is inevitable that parts of moving equipment such as lifts will deteriorate over time due to wear and tear, and aging. Timely replacements of parts that have worn out or broken are critical in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the lift. Examples include brake pads, wire ropes and insulation layer of electrical wiring. 
1. The use of deteriorated parts will eventually lead to failure and breakdown of the lift which may result in unsafe conditions, disruption to service, and costly emergency rescue and repairs. 

   3. Parts<a name="_page4_x69.00_y256.92"></a> Obsolescence  

1\.3.1  Furthermore, for old lifts, the availability of original parts will decrease over time as these  are  phased  out  of  production  with  technological  advancements.  Seeking  part replacements will become more difficult and costlier as compared to when the lift is new. Preparation for parts obsolescence (including budgeting for lift replacement or modernisation if necessary) should begin early in the lifetime of the lift. 

<a name="_page5_x69.00_y72.92"></a>2**  MAINTENANCE CONTROL PLAN 

1. An MCP is a document that is owned by the lift owner, and is prepared with his lift service contractor, in consultation with the OEM of the equipment. The objective of the MCP is to document detailed information on criteria (such as frequency, usage cycles or condition) for which a safety critical component ought to be replaced, in order to ensure the safe operation of the lift. 
1. With the MCP, both the owner and the lift service contractor will have a common ground on the criteria under which the identified safety component must be replaced. This removes any potential dispute between the owner and the lift service contractor, as well as undesired delay in part replacement. It is not uncommon for a lift owner to delay a part replacement in a basic maintenance contract under which lift owner will pay for the cost of replacement; and for a lift service contractor to delay a part replacement in a comprehensive maintenance contract under which the cost of replacement is covered by the contract price.[^3] 
1. Scope<a name="_page5_x69.00_y337.92"></a> of MCP 

   2\.3.1  There are many components in a lift. Some of these are safety critical, failing of which the lift should not be allowed in operation. The MCP, co-developed by the owner with his lift service contractor, must at least cover these safety critical components (as listed in Table2 below).

*Figure 1: Major Lift Parts*  

4. Replacement<a name="_page6_x69.00_y470.92"></a> Criteria for Safety Critical Components 
1. The approach to determining replacement criteria could generally be classified under two main groups: 
1. Measurable components – These are usually mechanical components. The conditions of these components are quantifiable through measurements or visual inspections. For  example,  wire  rope  diameter  and  brake  pad  thickness.  For  some  of  these components, the lifespan or condition could be restored with proper repair. For those that are beyond repaired, replacement will be necessary. 

   To determine the replacement criteria, the lift owner and his service contractor could refer to (i) the relevant standards or codes; and (ii) recommendations of the OEM. Usually, the more stringent requirements will apply. For example, ISO 4344 on Steel Wire Ropes for Lifts requires the replacement of wire rope when the diameter of the rope is reduced by 6% or more. 

2. Non-measurable components – These are typically electrical/electronic components whose conditions are difficult to ascertain based on measurement, inspection, or testing.  In  such  scenarios,  the  general  practice  towards  replacement  of  these components  is  based  on  the  manufacturer’s  recommended  usage  or  time-based frequency. The owner is also advised to conduct regular reviews with the contractor to determine the likelihood of obsolescence/wear and tear and consider alternative compatible parts if necessary. 

*Table 3: Type of Replacement* 



|Type of replacement |Applicable for  |What to do |
| - | - | - |
|Condition-based |For measurable parts (e.g., mechanical components) |Follow code requirement or manufacturer’s replacement criteria and adopt two-stage monitoring approach (see Section 2.5) |
|Frequency-based |For non-measurable parts (e.g., electronic components) |Follow manufacturer’s recommended replacement frequency  |

2. Please refer **Annexes A** and **B** for detailed information on the suggested replacement criteria for the safety critical components. 
5. Two-Stage<a name="_page7_x69.00_y451.92"></a> Approach 
1. This Guide recommends a two-stage approach for replacement of condition-based parts  –  the  first  stage  is  to  trigger  the  indentation  and  procurement  of  the  relevant replacement part; and the second stage is when the part must be replaced immediately, or the lift must be suspended from operation to ensure safety. 
1. The First Stage: Triggering of Indentation and Procurement of Parts. In the MCP, the lift owner and his service contractor should identify the condition or time at which the part replacement process is triggered, and the replacement part must be indented and procured. The criterion/criteria largely depend on the availability of the replacement part with the lift service  contractor,  as  well  as  the  shipment  lead time  required  if the part  is not  readily available locally. 
1. For example, for the replacement of wire ropes, typically the contractor would require ordering and shipping from overseas supplier and this process would usually takes 2 to 3 months. Based on the general wear rate of wire ropes in normal usage, this replacement process should be initiated between the contractor and the owner when the rope diameter reduction reaches 4%. This is to allow sufficient time for the replacement to take place before the rope diameter reduction reaches 6%.  
4. Other factors to consider  for setting criterion for the first stage  may include the building operation, e.g. the lift could only be shut down for rope replacement on weekends. 
4. The Second Stage: Replacement of Relevant Part Must Be Carried Out. At this stage, the relevant part must be replaced immediately as replacement criteria have been reached. Otherwise, the lift owner must suspend the operation of the lift. From the above example, if rope replacement was not carried out when the diameter reduction reaches 6%, the lift should not be in operation until the rope has been replaced.    
4. Below are two examples illustrating the concept of two-stage monitoring. ***Example for 2-stage monitoring – Ropes***

<a name="_page10_x69.00_y72.92"></a>3**  LIFT MODERNISATION 

1. Due to technological advancements in the safety standards established worldwide, it is inevitable that over time, gaps emerge between the existing lifts technology and the latest technology and code requirements. In addition, the performance of the lift could decline, and more errors could occur as the components age, resulting in frequent breakdowns. Parts obsolescence could also limits availability and access to parts, resulting in increased cost and difficulty in maintenance of lifts as it age.  
1. Lift modernisation is the process of carrying out upgrading works of either the entire lift  or  certain  critical  lift  components.  This  will  rejuvenate  the  lifts  with  modern  safety enhancements, making them safer and more efficient and reliable. For example, in changing from the older brake design with single plunger to a new permanent magnet traction machine with multiple disc brakes, the new system will provide better safety features and typically require fewer repairs, thus lower maintenance costs.  
1. For older lifts that have significant disparity between previous design standards and current code requirements, total replacement is recommended. Total replacement refers to the complete replacement to a brand-new lift compliant with latest code requirements. 
1. In other settings in which the aged lift is relatively newer, owners may find that partial modernisation will be more suitable because the lift can still achieve the intended outcomes by being retrofitted with the additional items while being easier on the budget and reducing downtime of the lift. For such modernisation, the contractor will usually examine the entire lift and propose the items to modernise e.g., install Ascending Car Overspeed Protection (ACOP) device.  
1. Challenges<a name="_page10_x69.00_y505.92"></a> with Old Lifts 

   **Old lift design does not meet the latest Code requirements** 

1. Singapore lifts are designed and installed in accordance with Singapore Standards SS550: Code of Practice for Installation, Operation and Maintenance of Electric Passenger and Goods Lifts. The Standard is typically reviewed once every 5 years so that new developments in technology or industry practices are periodically updated into the Standard. Over the years, lifts that were based on older standards may have features that are no longer on par with the latest industry best practices. 
1. Generally, it is advisable for owners of lifts aged 15 years and older to discuss with their service contractor to identify components for modernisation so as to keep up to date with latest standards. 
3. Case<a name="_page11_x69.00_y72.92"></a> Study: Single-Plunger Brake Lift 
1. Brakes system is a critical component of a lift. For older lifts in Singapore that were designed to  Code  of  Practice  CP2:1979,  it was  common  that the  entire  brake  system  is actuated through a single plunger. While such design can continue to be used, it is critical that the single plunger brake must be properly maintained to be working at all times. As a single point of failure with no redundancy in the design, and any failure of the plunger can result in dangerous uncontrolled movement of the lift. 

![](Aspose.Words.88e47afa-a53f-4b42-8661-f27935639376.003.png)

*Figure 2: Single Plunger Brake* 

2. The revised Code of Practice, SS550:2009 requires a redundant set of brake system, and that each individual brake system can at least hold the lift with 125% rated loading. 
2. In  addition,  ACOP  and  Unintended  Car  Movement  Protection  (UCMP)  were  first required  in  SS550:2009  and  its  subsequent  amendments.  These  improvements  further mitigate the risks of over-speeding upwards and uncontrolled car movements. 
2. Recommended  solutions.  To  address  the  risks  posed  by  single-plunger  brake  lift installed more than 20 years ago (prior to CP2:2000), it is recommended that owners change to a newer traction machine which has redundant brakes design and self-monitoring features compliant with SS550:2020.  
2. Although  there  are  other  possible  solutions  such  as  adding  rope  gripper  and  in conjunction with ACOP/UCMP, these old lifts also face additional challenges including parts obsolescence  and  retrofitting  constraints  (such  as  space  constraint  and  controller incompatibility). Therefore, it might be more economical for owners to consider traction machine modernisation. 
6. In addition, when modernising the brakes, the owner and contractor  should also include the ACOP and UCMP if these features have not been installed. 
6. Parts<a name="_page12_x69.00_y113.92"></a> obsolescence 
1. Parts  obsolescence  is  inevitable  due  to  technological  advancements  and  product developments. As the lifts age, it also becomes increasingly difficult to source for new parts, especially for electrical and electronic components such as printed circuit boards which are commonly used in the controller and car door control circuits. Thus, part of the modernisation strategy would also need to consider parts obsolescence and the components which will be impacted, with the view to modernise if necessary.   
1. The format below may be useful for owner to plan for electrical/electronic parts obsolescence.

3. Case<a name="_page13_x69.00_y240.92"></a> Study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) 
1. PCB is widely used in lifts. The PCB can be found in many applications such as hall call panel, car door control circuit, car-top control panel, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), UCMP  detection  circuit,  traction  machine  drive  and  main  controller.  Unlike  most  of  the mechanical  parts  which  are  designed  to  have  a  longer  life  span,  PCBs  which  contains electronic devices have a relatively shorter life span. 
1. As PCBs are often customized for certain circuitries and applications, it may be difficult to find an exact one-to-one replacement, unlike other mechanical or electrical components. Therefore, PCBs should be closely monitored for parts obsolescence to avoid disruption to the lift operation. 
7. Maintenance<a name="_page13_x69.00_y462.92"></a> Difficulties 
1. Older lifts may be more difficult to maintain and achieving the maintenance outcomes required by BCA. For example, lifts using an aged controller can be challenging to achieve the required  levelling  accuracy  of  ±10mm,  as  older  technology  can  typically  only  achieve approximately ±30mm levelling accuracy. This may pose a tripping risk to users.   
1. Case<a name="_page13_x69.00_y572.92"></a> Study: Outdated Relay-Logic Controller and Motor Starter 
1. Some of the older lifts possess an outdated relay-logic controller, and the entire controller or certain components could have already become obsolete. Such lifts using single- speed or double-speed motor control that were installed in the 1980s are referred to as AC1 or AC2 lifts for single-speed lift and double-speed lift, respectively. 

   **Levelling & Ride Comfort Issue** 

15 

2. The  control  over  single  and  double-speed  lift  is limited. It is very difficult for the AC1/AC2 lifts to achieve the levelling accuracy and ride comfort. In comparison, newer lifts use a modern inverter drive with advanced control over the starting acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the motor and  the  lift  car,  and  therefore  smooth  rides  and  accurate levelling at the landing can be achieved. For double-speed lift, stopping accuracy of ±½ to 1in. (about 13 to 24mm) can be obtained under all conditions of load, as contrasted with one- speed accuracy of 1 to 3 in. (about 24 to 75 mm), which will vary with load. With modern controller and inverter drive, a much more accurate levelling (within ± 10mm) can be easily achieved.

*Figure 3: Outdated Lift Controller* 



3. Bad levelling accuracy poses tripping risks to users entering or exiting the lift. In case of a wheelchair or PMD user, the level difference can constitute more danger when reversing the PMD or wheelchair out of the lift.  
8. Recommended<a name="_page14_x69.00_y422.92"></a> Items to be modernised  
1. This section provides two lists of items to be considered for lift modernisation. Table 7 contains safety critical items that should be given priority and urgency in modernisation. Table  8  includes  additional  components/subsystems  which  should  also be  considered  to further improve the safety, reliability as well as ride comfort of the lift. 
1. For those modernisation items which are considered major alteration, readers may refer to the Good Practices Guide for Lift Owners to find out more details of major alteration and its requirement.

9. Condition<a name="_page19_x69.00_y679.92"></a> Assessment for Old Lifts (15 years and older) 
1. For lifts that are 15 years or older and have not undergone modernisation, the owner should carry out condition assessment for these lifts. The conditional assessment should cover minimally the safety critical components as given in **Annex C**. This is to ensure that the lifts are still in good condition for continuing operation. Such assessments are more thorough and in depth than inspections carried out during the yearly inspection and testing for Permit- To-Operate renewal. 
2. The  condition  assessment  should  be  carried  out  by  accredited  Inspection  Bodies acceptable to BCA.  
2. The condition assessment of these safety critical parts should continue to be carried out at least once every 5 yearly until the replacement or modernisation of the components takes  place.  You  may  refer  to  **Annex  C**  for  details  on  the  tests  suggested  for  condition assessments of these components. 
2. Additionally, the Inspection Bodies typically can also assess the level of compliance of the existing lift installation to the latest code and regulatory requirements, and highlight the gaps for owner’s consideration to modernise the lift for increased safety and reliability.  
2. As  the  performance  of  lift  components  deteriorates  over  time  depending  on frequency of lift usage, the owner should exercise discretion to conduct condition assessment ahead of the 15-year mark when necessary. 

   <a name="_page21_x69.00_y72.92"></a>**4  LOGBOOK**  

1. Logbooks are essential  to the life cycle maintenance of lift as they provide detailed recording of works carried out on the lift. These include, but are not limited to, records on routine servicing,  parts replacements,  call-backs, incidents, annual testing, and condition assessments. Each lift should have its own logbook. 
1. Electronic logbooks are preferred to hardcopy logbooks as they offer several advantages, including ease of access, improved accuracy, and the ability to store substantial amounts of data in a compact format. Electronic logbooks also allow for easy sharing of information between different stakeholders, such as lift maintenance contractors and building owners, which can help to improve communication and collaboration. 
1. It is recommended that the following records for each individual lift to be digitalised and included in the logbook in order to provide greater clarity on the overall lift conditions.

1  **Brakes**

Lift brakes are electromechanical devices which are normally closed by compression spring force and opened when the plunger is activated by electrical energy to push the brakes apart. There are several different types of brakes available in the market such as drum, calliper and block brakes. Though the operational concept is similar, the physical configuration of these components may differ. The expected functional outcomes and the failure symptoms for the respective brake components are explained below: 

Table A1: Brake Information 



|Brake Type |Model Number |Installed on |Installed by |
| - | - | - | - |
|||||
Monitoring Brake Slip Distance  

To be  based  on Manufacturer’s  Recommendations on  test  methods, test frequency  and acceptance criteria. 

To be carried out at least once yearly Table A2: Brake Slip Distance
